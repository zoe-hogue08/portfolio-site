  <p>Originally invented by Samuel Morse in the 1830s, this was a way for the U.S. to communicate with Europe. Morse code is a sequence of "dits" and "dahs," using a telegraph key to send electrical pulses down a wire or through the air, which are then interpreted by a receiving sounder or other device. The only way for this machine to work is to install some sort of cable for other parts of the world to communicate. So, that's what they did. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_W._Field">Cyrus West Field</a> was the organizer for this to work. In 1858, this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transatlantic_telegraph_cable">cable</a> was installed so that the U.S. could communicate with Europe. Not only was this the first efficient way to communicate, but more and more cables were laid throughout the years.</p>

<p> <i>This is a diagram to show how the Morse code language is brought to life.</i> </p>
<p> Over time, this machine has been slowly advanced to phones, keyboards, and calling systems. As we know, this machine is used with short electric currents through the transmitter. This machine also has a light attached to it, including the <a href="https://www.offgridweb.com/preparation/morse-code-dits-dahs-dots-and-dashes/">"dits" and "dahs"</a> - although there are still buzzing noises to signal the letters. </p>
